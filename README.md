# Rainbow stickers

Tiny stickers for the promotion of queer discourse within predominantly cisheteronormative spaces: each has a pride flag with a thematic icon on it in the middle, with text above and below it. These stickers are really tiny, so many fit on a single A4 adhesive sheet of paper, to be DIYedâ€¦

## How to contribute

Technically, using the regular Git way (clone, change, pull request) or via email (foo@digitalwords.net).

What's needed?
* Stickers in languages other than Hebrew (ideas and/or implementations of ideas). I want this to be multilingual.
* More stickers.
* Anything you think can help.
